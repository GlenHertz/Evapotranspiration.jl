# Evapotranspiration

Evapotranspiration models the process at which water is lost from the soil due to many factors.  You can use this to plan our your irrigation/sprinkler system to get an estimate how much water to use depending on the location and the weather forecast.

The formulas come from the [Crop evapotranspiration - Guidelines for computing crop water requirements - FAO Irrigation and drainage paper 56](http://www.fao.org/docrep/x0490e/x0490e00.htm).
